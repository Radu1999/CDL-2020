# In File Search Engine

The Engine uses queries written in logical form to find all documents that meet a certain logical scheme based on the containing words.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

The program has a build system based on a Makefile, so in order to get it to work you will run the following command

```
make build
```

## Running the tests

The program can be run using the following command

```
python3 SchEng.py
```

This will open a Graphical User Interface, where you have to select the path of the documents you are looking for and to write the logical expression
